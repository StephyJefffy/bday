                        Roses are Red, Violets are Blue
                        Love never crossed my mind until i met you,
                        You enchanted my heart you enchanted my soul,
                        And after that day you were my one and only goal,
                        You are my world, My girl the one i adore,
                        And as days passed by i just wanted to know you more and more,
                        I know you love my corny jokes,
                        But man i hope you dont choke,
                        Because I'd like us to commit the perfect crime
                        I'll steal your heart and you can steal mine
                        So Breanna please be my Valentine.
